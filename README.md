# SENG 405 Project
## Movie-Seat-Booking

This project has the following capabilities already
1. Saving of selected seats across browser sessions.
2. Automatic selected seat count update.
3. Automatic selected seat price update.

### Features to be implemented:
* ✔️Setting of selected seats to occupied
    -
    This can be done via a button on the html file. 

* ✔️Saving the occupied across sessions
    - 
    Probably through the `localStorage.setItem()` method.

* ❌Loading occupied seats for each movie after switching
    -
    Will need to load this after every change event on the movie selector.
